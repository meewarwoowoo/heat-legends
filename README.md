## 1963/1964
As with the Alan Moore comic book, the end of 1963 lets the rest down.  The whole season is a race too long in my opinion, and so I've given the option to replace the old 1963 with two new seasons.  I've spent far too long in my life thinking about new events so on and when it came to actually adding them here I picked these:

1963 - 3 - Title Showdown: All drivers get 50% bonus to Championship points for this race.
1964 - 1 - Slow Heating Car: Start the race with a hand size of six, and add one to your hand size each lap. Use car position at step nine when drawing.
1964 - 2 - Easy Driving Engine: If you have discarded any Heat cards this turn, you may also discard a Stress card from your hand.
1964 - 1 - Racing Celebration: Podium Points increased to 10, 8 and 6 for Winner, Runner-up and third respectively.
